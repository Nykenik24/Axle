	Short: "Generates a lockfile",
	Long:  `The lock command generates a lockfile that records the exact versions of all installed dependencies, ensuring that the project’s environment remains consistent across different machines or environments. The lockfile serves as a snapshot of the current dependency tree, including specific versions and configurations. By using the lockfile, you can guarantee that all developers and build environments are using the same versions of dependencies, preventing issues caused by version discrepancies.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// lockCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// lockCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
